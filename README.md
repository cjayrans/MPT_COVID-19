# Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) for Pre and Post COVID Market Environments

Modern Portfolio Theory is a theory on how to optimize returns based on a given level of market risk observed using historical data. Modern portfolio theory argues that an investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. Likewise, given a desired level of expected return, an investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk.

Given the impact COVID-19 had had on the market starting February 24, 2020, we look to see how optimal portfolios made up of the same assets change given different economic conditions.
